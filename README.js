# CS397_SearchableSlides
A tool to search for keywords in a video of lecture slides

Todo:

• Given a single picture of a slide, can we read the text from it?

• Given a video of lecture slides, can we detect when the slides change?

• Can we timestamp slide changes?

• Can we get the words on the slides in the video and timestamp those?

• Can we timestamp the video before we begin watching it (ie. as soon as it is loaded)?

• Can we search for words in some GUI and get the appropriate timestamps?

• Can we do the above on a mobile device?

• Can we, in real-time, timestampt the video on a phone (ie. the phone camera is streaming the lecture)?

• ???
