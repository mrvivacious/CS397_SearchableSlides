CS397_SearchableSlides
A tool to search for keywords in a video of lecture slides

To do:
By September 13:
√ Given a single picture of a slide, can we read the text from it?

  + https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-extract-text-from-an-image-using-javascript-8fe282fb0e71/

Sept 27:
o Given a video of lecture slides, can we detect when the slides change?

o Can we timestamp slide changes?

Oct 4:
o Can we get the words on the slides in the video and timestamp those?
o Can we search for words in some GUI and get the appropriate timestamps?

Oct 25:
o Can we do the above on a mobile device?

Unknown deadline (cannot predict time required as I have no relevant experience to base expectations on)
o Can we timestamp the video before we begin watching it (ie. as soon as it is loaded)?
o Can we, in real-time, timestampt the video on a phone (ie. the phone camera is streaming the lecture)?
o ???
